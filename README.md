# Liri-node-app

Hi, this is my Liri  Node App!

Let me tell you what it does:
It uses 3 API's to recall information.
You type in a search, (ie.. Song, movie, band name..)
It searches for it!

Have fun! You just need to enter a command: 
* Item 1 movie-this 
* Item 1 concert-this 
* Item 1 spotify-this 
* Item 1 do-what-it-says
